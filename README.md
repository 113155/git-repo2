# Markdown file
Includes markdown syntax

This file is intended to get one familiar with the commonly used **markdown syntaxes.**
We have different syntaxes for the following;
1. Headings
2. Emphasis. 
...This can be changing the text to any of these;
....* bold
....* italics
etc.
```javascript
window.onload = function (){
    let paragraph = document.createElement("p");
    let html = "<p> Click the link below to view more </p>"
    paragraph.innerHTML = html;
}
```
